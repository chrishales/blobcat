BLOBCAT
=======

![logo](./blobcat.jpg)

Software to catalogue blobs.

See http://blobcat.sourceforge.net for details and downloading instructions.

Note: BLOBCAT is not available at this github repository. I maintain this repository to ensure that my github account lists all of my software.

Credit: I thank Daniel Weisz for designing the blobcat logo.
